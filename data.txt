If you indeed are a Backend Engineer and are looking for a stable, mature and friendly team, join in and help us designing great public transit APIs!</p>\n<h2>A quick look at us</h2>\n<p>The subject of mobility is evolving at a startling pace. Fundamentals are being questioned, new ways of getting around are emerging and challenging the established ones. At moovel (becomes REACH NOW), we aim to take part in shaping that future. Software is eating the world and mobility is certainly no exception. Ultimately, we want to help cities become smarter by building on the operational wisdom of city administrations and mobility service providers. We don\'t want to disrupt, but augment the means of getting around by employing contemporary technology.</p>\n<p>The problems we are engaging are manifold and from the real world. Our solutions do not only have an impact on a single industry branch, but also aim to transform the city. They involve fields like routing, searching, AI, innovative UX and much more. Things are very dynamic in the mobility space and thus we devote ourselves to a lot of exploratory work.</p>\n<h2>How the role works</h2>\n<p>We gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. Individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility, where innovation is very much encouraged and embraced. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.</p>\n<p>With us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel (becomes REACH NOW) tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>Squads at moovel (becomes REACH NOW) choose the tools that fit their problems best, at their discretion. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it!). We own the full application lifecycle from ideation phase to end-to-end operating services, while practicing Continuous Delivery.</p>\n<h2>Some of the things you will do</h2>\n<p>At the Transit team, we’re pretty flexible on our day-to-day business, so we take trust in very high regard!

Wij zijn verantwoordelijk voor alle systemen die Luchtverkeersleiding Nederland (LVNL) gebruikt. Binnen S&amp;I is de afdeling Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) verantwoordelijk voor alle ICT Systemen die Luchtverkeersleiders gebruiken om hun dagelijkse werk te kunnen doen en voor de simulatoren die gebruikt worden om Luchtverkeersleiders te trainen.</p>\n<p>De afdeling ATMS is in vier teams onderverdeeld, elk met zijn eigen focusgebied: Torensystemen (TWR), Radarverkeersleiding systemen (AAA en iCAS) en Informatiesystemen (IS). De teams bestaan allen uit ca. 15 tot 20 vaste medewerkers, aangevuld door inhuurkrachten. Samen zorgen zij voor een circa 35 systemen, deels ingekocht bij leveranciers en deels zelf ontwikkeld.</p>\n<p>Je kunt aan de slag binnen het team Tower of het team Information Systems. Afhankelijk van de behoefte aan jouw expertise kun je binnen de afdeling ATMS verplaatst worden.</p>\n<p><strong>De baan</strong></p>\n<p>Als Software Developer ATMS werk je aan het door ontwikkelen van de systemen waar de luchtverkeersleiding mee werkt.</p>\n<p>Binnen het team Tower werk je aan systemen zoals het Torensysteem, dat de vertrekplanning maakt en radarschermen toont, en de systemen die nodig zijn om luchtverkeersleiders te trainen in de simulator. Binnen het team Information Systems zal je onder andere werken aan het Control Center Circuit Information System v2 (CCISv2). Dat systeem biedt luchtverkeersleiders informatie over onder andere meteo, de baanplanning, de luchthaven en de systeemstatus van bijvoorbeeld de automatisch landingssystemen.</p>\n<p>Alle systemen die gebruikt worden voor Luchtverkeersleiding dienen uiterst solide en consistent te zijn. Software ontwikkeling doen wij in sprints en op basis van Agile/scrum. De software wordt m.b.v. een release opgeleverd op een aantal omgevingen. Testautomatisering is doorgevoerd om efficiënter een kwalitatief acceptabel product te leveren. De releases worden gerealiseerd op basis van voorschriften in een software assurance system. De externe toezichthouder voert regelmatig een audit uit op het voldoen aan deze voorschriften.</p>\n<p>Naast het ontwikkelen van software zal je als Software Developer ook gevraagd worden voor het oplossen van storingen (3e lijn onderhoud), bijhouden van (opleidings-)documentatie en onderhoudsprocedures en ben je een aanspreekpunt voor de mensen die het 1e en 2e lijn onderhoud aan de systemen uitvoeren.</p>\n<p><strong>Ontwikkelingen</strong></p>\n<p>In de komende 3-5 jaar vinden er belangrijke veranderingen plaats rond enkele systemen. Zo zullen het Torensysteem en het Radarverkeersleidingsysteem AAA, die wij beide zelf in beheer hebben, volledig vervangen worden door aangekochte systemen (TWR2020 en iCAS). Daarnaast is er voor de verdere doorontwikkeling van CCISv2 in 2018 door LVNL een samenwerkingstraject gestart met de Duitse luchtverkeersleiding (DFS). Dit betekent dat ook functionele veranderingen ten behoeve van de DFS in CCISv2 gerealiseerd worden. Deze veranderingen betekenen dat het ontwikkelwerk van de Software Developers zich in de toekomst meer zal richten op de simulatoren en dataverwerkingssystemen en dat er meer configuratie en adaptatie werk voor de ingekochte systemen gedaan zal worden.</p>\n<p><strong>Wie ben jij?</strong></p>\n<p>Veiligheid is onze hoogste prioriteit en vakkundigheid staat voorop.

Wat wij maken móet goed zijn, omdat de toekomst van mensen ervan afhangt. Wordt iemand vrijgesproken of schuldig bevonden? De eerste 48 uur in een opsporingsonderzoek zijn cruciaal. Met het door NFI ontwikkelde bigdata-platform Hansken kunnen forensisch onderzoekers snel de juiste informatie vinden in enorme hoeveelheden data. Als forensisch software-engineer aan jou de uitdaging om mee te werken aan de doorontwikkeling en verbetering van dit unieke en internationaal vooraanstaande platform.</p>\n<p>Binnen de Nederlandse strafrechtketen bestaat de noodzaak om op digitaal forensisch gebied de opsporingskracht en snelheid te vergroten met behoud van de forensische kwaliteit. Dit om aan de alsmaar groeiende en veranderde onderzoeksvraag te kunnen voldoen. In 2014 is door het NFI het platform Hansken ontworpen om in beslag genomen en gevorderde digitale dataverzamelingen inzichtelijk en toegankelijk te maken voor digitaal en tactisch onderzoekers. De afgelopen jaren is het platform in gebruik en succesvol toegepast bij onder andere de politie en FIOD en heeft zich nationaal bewezen in meer dan vijfhonderd zaakonderzoeken. Internationaal is er nu ook belangstelling voor het gebruik van het platform en de wetenschappelijke wereld wil het platform inzetten voor R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>Het NFI blijft Hansken doorontwikkelen en de forensische mogelijkheden ervan verder uitbreiden. Hansken moet dan ook hét data-analyseplatform worden. Een platform dat breed in zaakonderzoeken wordt toegepast door tactische rechercheurs van de (inter)nationale rechtshandhaving voor het inzichtelijk en toegankelijk maken van digitale data.</p>\n<p>Voor deze doorontwikkelingen werk jij als software-engineer samen met jouw collega’s aan innovatie en verdere uitbreiding van forensische mogelijkheden van Hansken. Het team waarin je komt te werken is hecht en kenmerkt zich door zijn open en directe sfeer. Een team waar je elkaar helpt om samen te komen tot oplossingen van complexe casussen.</p>\n<p><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></p>\n<p>Je gaat aan de slag met het ontwikkelen van data-analyseapplicaties en softwarebibliotheken. Het reverse engineeren van onbekende bestandsformaten of bestandssystemen om forensische sporen zichtbaar te maken is een belangrijk onderdeel van je werk. Je duikt in lowlevel-datastructuren en algoritmiek en haalt hierbij de betekenis van de laatste bit boven water.</p>\n<p>Je bent betrokken bij het gehele ontwikkeltraject, van een idee dat je soms zelf bent gestart tot het bieden van hulp bij het gebruik van de software. De software wordt voornamelijk in Java ontwikkeld, maar ook andere programmeertalen en webapplicaties worden als frameworks gebruikt.</p>\n<p>Verder lever je een belangrijke bijdrage aan de verbetering van het vakgebied software-engineering. Je denkt mee over een efficiënte inrichting van het ontwikkelproces, waarbij de forensische kennis zo goed mogelijk geborgd wordt.</p>\n<p>Jouw werk heeft dus impact op de samenleving.

Je bent een teamspeler, krijgt energie van samenwerken en neemt graag initiatief. Daarnaast ben je kritisch en werk je op een nauwkeurige, systematische manier, en toets je jouw resultaten bij je collega’s. Je hebt een pragmatische aanpak en denkt vanuit een oplossingsgerichte instelling actief mee over de vraag. Je deelt graag je kennis en ervaringen en bent nieuwsgierig naar de ideeën van anderen. Je bent analytisch erg sterk ontwikkeld en weet door je structurele werkwijze goed met deadlines te werken. Je gaat werken in een agile-ontwikkelteam, dus je bent communicatief vaardig, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbeids\xadvoorwaarden</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Salaris\xadniveau</strong> schaal 10, schaal 11</p>\n<p><strong>Salaris\xadomschrijving</strong> Op deze functie is het Functiegebouw Rijk van toepassing.

And when we say ‘platform’, we mean it. Well over 23,500 external partners – and counting – enrich the product base. Data-driven, adventurous (making mistakes is no biggie, as long as learnings are shared), we intend to deliver on our promise to make life easier and more fun for customers. And that is exactly what our 500 IT professionals (25% internationals), who comprise 90+ autonomous Scrum teams, do.</p>\n<p><strong>The biggest challenge</strong>\nAlthough our business model may sound familiar, our approach to network retailing sets us apart from the usual suspects. So much so, in fact, that while we admire the achievements of international platforms, we don’t necessarily consider them our peers.

At bol.com, we are big on autonomy, and that makes us strong: we expect you to make all (technical) choices along the way but also to assume ownership when things go awry. You build it – you run it – you love it is our mantra, and we live it every day. Every Scrum team is part of a Fleet – every Fleet part of a Space.</p>\n<p>As for your GPS location within the bol.com universe, check out which one you may call your (temporary, because moving between spaces is possible) home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://careers.bol.com/tech/spaces/">Check out our spaces</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>No matter the space you’ll join, your tech stack includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java (8!)</li>\n<li>Kotlin</li>\n<li>GO</li>\n<li>Google Cloud stack</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3 reasons why this is(n’t) for you</strong>\nv\tBecause you take pride in writing high quality code, and are versed in Java and (some of) ↑\nv\tBecause you’re a true pioneer, both when it comes to coding and tooling\nv\tBecause you want to team up with a market leader that feels like a scaleup</p>\n<p>×\tBecause business concerns don’t concern you #letthemeatcode\n×\tBecause you don’t believe the land of ‘weed, windmills and wooden shoes’ has much to offer to techies\n×\tBecause you want to be taken by the hand; autonomy &amp; ownership are not your thing</p>\n<p><strong>Where you’ll work</strong>\nAs Software Engineer, you’ll join a Scrum team you can always rely on for feedback and continuous professional growth. The setting? Think ‘campus’, including a game room and soccer field. Despite our size, we make fun of rigid rules and traditional work structures. We may be a market leader, but you won’t get a whiff of the corporate odor you associate with that. Our strength derives from working together as equals and constantly improving each other. After all, you can accomplish great things on your own, but so much more with your colleagues!

Voel jij je thuis op een afdeling met 8 scrum teams? Wil je je nog verder ontwikkelen als Java developer?</strong></p>\n<p>Als Java developer bij de Volksbank duik jij in innovaties die de hypotheekdienstverlening voor onze klanten, adviseurs en medewerkers versnellen, verbeteren en vereenvoudigen. Dankzij jou hebben we een wendbaar applicatielandschap dat aan de backend op-en-top functioneert.</p>\n<p>Bij de Volksbank ontwikkelen we een deel van onze responsive webapplicaties zelf. Jij speelt een belangrijke rol in de ontwikkeling en architectuur voor de backend services.. Als Java developer ontwerp, bouw, test, beheer en documenteer je API’s, die er achter de schermen voor zorgen dat verschillende applicaties met elkaar kunnen communiceren. Dit ontwikkel je binnen ons Business Services Platform gebasseerd op de principes van microservices. We zitten in de transitie naar container en cloudtechnologie middels Kubernetes. Je kunt hierin een wezenlijke bijdrage leveren. Vanuit je rol heb je oog voor requirements, architectuur maar ook voor applicatie beheer.</p>\n<p>In een multidisciplinair scrumteam werk je aan projecten die passen bij jouw ervaring, interesses en achtergrond. Om je werk goed te kunnen doen heb je regelmatig contact met je product owner en je collega’s uit de business zoals merk vertegenwoordigers en adviseurs om de wensen van de gebruikers helder te krijgen. Die vertaal je samen met je collega’s naar slimme technische oplossingen.</p>\n<h2>Hier kom je te werken</h2>\n<p>Jij gaat werken bij een van de scrumteams van de value-organisatie. Jouw team ontwikkelt applicaties die nodig zijn om veranderingen in de business te realiseren en implementeren op het gebied van betalen, wonen, finance en risk, en klantrelaties. Ook zelf zijn we volop in ontwikkeling. Zo beland je midden in de transitie naar DevOps-teams en krijg je de kans om mee te denken over verbetering en verandering. Hoewel je standplaats Den Bosch is, kan het zijn dat je ook regelmatig thuis of op onze locatie in Utrecht werkt.</p>\n<h2>Dit krijg je van ons</h2>\n<p><strong>Complexe uitdagingen</strong></p>\n<p>Een IT-bedrijf met de blik op de toekomst. Wij zorgen dat miljoenen mensen altijd en overal kunnen betalen, sparen of geld kunnen lenen om hun ambities waar te maken. Door te blijven innoveren met creatieve IT-oplossingen help jij onze klanten financieel weerbaarder te worden.</p>\n<p><strong>Fijne werkplek</strong></p>\n<p>Ons kantoor ligt aan de A2 in het gezellige Den Bosch. Wij werken in open agile ruimtes en denken niet in afdelingen. Wil jij je energie kwijt? Onze collega’s houden wel van een spelletje. Er zijn genoeg mogelijkheden: een flipperkast, voetbaltafel of een gameroom met Playstations.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbeidsvoorwaarden</strong></p>\n<p>Naast jouw salaris profiteer je van een individueel keuzebudget (IKB), waarmee je zelf kiest wanneer je jouw vakantiegeld en dertiende maand ontvangt. Ook zorgen we voor een goede balans tussen werk en vrije tijd. Jij bepaalt – in overleg – zelf waar en wanneer je werkt.</p>\n<p><strong>Jouw ontwikkeling</strong></p>\n<p>Binnen onze teams wordt voortdurend informatie en kennis uitgewisseld. Wil je je verdiepen in iOS, een zelfstudie volgen via Google University of jouw Java kennis uitbreiden? Van ons krijg je een go.</p>\n<h2>Jouw kwaliteiten</h2>\n<p>Een ervaren professional met een flinke dosis lef en een aanstekelijke teamspirit. Dat ben jij in een notendop. Daarnaast beschik je over een kritische blik, het vermogen om complexe problemen te analyseren en de vindingrijkheid om eenvoudige creatieve oplossingen te bedenken. Als senior Java developer overzie jij het geheel in het applicatielandschap, help je ons de juiste richting te bepalen, ben je een goede sparringpartner en coach je nieuwe ontwikkelaars. Nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen volg je op de voet, bijvoorbeeld doordat je onze lezingen, meet ups, pizzasessies en hackathons bijwoont. Natuurlijk deel je de kennis die je opdoet vervolgens graag met je collega\'s.</p>\n<p><em>Verder heb je</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Een hbo- of wo-diploma, bij voorkeur in de richting van software-engineering of computerscience</li>\n<li>Meerdere jaren ervaring met backend-ontwikkeling</li>\n<li>Ervaring met Java-frameworks, zoals Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring REST, JAX-RS, JAXB, JPA, JUnit, MongoDB, JBoss en Mockito</li>\n<li>Kennis van onder meer IntelliJ , Maven, SQL Databases, Kubernetes en Git</li>\n<li>Bij voorkeur ervaring met frontend-technologieën</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Solliciteren?</h2>\n<p>Upload je motivatie en cv via <a href="https://vonq.io/2EAHF7f">deze link</a>.

De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></h2>\n<p>Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.\nJe gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).\nVoor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier</p>\n<h2><strong>Wie zoeken wij</strong></h2>\n<p>Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is.

Je bent analytisch, creatief, denkt in oplossingen, leert snel, bent een pionier en kan ingewikkelde materie op aansprekende wijze uitleggen aan collega’s die minder van techniek weten. Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.</p>\n<h2><strong>Waar kom je te werken</strong></h2>\n<p>Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there\'s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we\'ve created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</p>\n<p>We don’t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you\'ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p>\n<p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>You don\'t have to worry about the company running out of money.</p>\n<p>8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p>\n<p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</p>\n<p>Here’s What We Expect From You…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re excellent at PHP</li>\n<li>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li>\n<li>You\'ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li>\n<li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li>\n<li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li>\n<li>You have an excellent attention to detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n<h3>The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you\'re responsible for.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases.

Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n<p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.\nFor reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>\n<li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>\n<li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n<li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n<li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n<li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n<li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n<p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>\n<p><strong>About Analytics Fire</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n<p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p>\n', 'how_to_apply': '<p>Please email your resume and cover letter to <a href="mailto:join-us@analyticsfire.com">join-us@analyticsfire.com</a></p>\n', 'company_logo': 'https://jobs.github.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBZ2xYIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--89248bd5c549d217b732c30844d17e6d0564f721/37d142ea-7772-45d9-8ebd-7fd489926dad'}
